Because this format is really easy to parse. it'll be like the platformer game

Unlike the platformer, Objects will not have arbituary positions and it's basically strictly tile locked.
Also because A* is now a thing. To avoid killing my memory and muh framerate. Each level needs to have an explicitly set size for the A* grid map.

*amap *w *h (IN ABSOLUTE SIZES. THE EDITOR STILL SNAPS IT IN PLACE.)
*block_type* *x* *y* *texture_location*
