Ahhh this one is still fresh smelling given it's been dead for less than a few months.

This is the most recent project I've made (avaliable anyways) and it really nicely shows my evolution.
Evidently there are things wrong with it, somethings are very old habits.

But this time I think I did much better in efficiency.

This is by far the second most complete game I've ever made.
It simply suffers from a lack of content.

Otherwise the game is functionally complete as clunky as it is.
